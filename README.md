- By the keyboard shortcuts `ALT + C`.
- By the Obsidian command `Open Lightweight ChatGPT Plugin Window`.

In the Lightweight ChatGPT Plugin Window, the content you selected in the current Markdown document will be copied to the text box automatically. So you can use this text to ask questions or perform other operations, or directly write down anything you want to say.
